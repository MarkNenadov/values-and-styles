# values-and-styles
My personal developer value and style guide.

### Values

* Be curious
* Question things. 
    * Especially "why" and "what"
    * Most questions aren't dumb: Being afraid to ask a question is dumb
* Share by default
* Don't take yourself too seriously
    * Hold your own conclusions, ideas, and plans loosely
    * Be willing to throw it away
    * Let others critique your stuff

### Style

#### Basic Principles
* Keep It Simple
* Someone is going to have to read this, maybe even a future you
* Be as idiomatic as you can
* Make it as immutable as you ca

Basic Principles
* Use Kotlin like a Kotlin programmer (especially important for those of us who came from java)

#### Typescript

* Take the time to get the typing right from the get-go

#### React

* One exported component per file (private sub components are fine)
